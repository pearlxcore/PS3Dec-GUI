# PS3Dec GUI

Yet another GUI for PS3Dec. My personal tool to handle PS3 ISO decryption. Support single and multiple file operation and iso extraction. The app will decrypt if DKEY and PS3 iso filename matched.

# How to use

  - Select single or multiple operation
  - For single file operation, drag and drop DKEY and PS3 iso file to input box respectively
  - For multiple file operation, drag and drop DKEY and PS3 iso folder to input box respectively
  - Specify decrypted iso directory
